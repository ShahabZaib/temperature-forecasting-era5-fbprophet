# How to Run This Project

This project builds a regional temperature forecasting pipeline using ERA5 reanalysis data and Facebook Prophet.

üëâ Please run the notebooks in the following order:

1. `hypothetical_stations.ipynb`
   - Generates 242 random weather station points using a shapefile.

2. `subset_era5_data.ipynb`
   - Run this notebook separately for each year.
   - It loads ERA5 NetCDF data and clips it to the generated stations.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you download ERA5 **hourly data** for each year (2015 to 2024) from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.

3. `merge_clean_data.ipynb`
   - Loads all yearly subsets and merges them into a single CSV file for modeling.

4. `fb_prophet_model.ipynb`
   - Trains one forecasting model per station using sliding windows.
   - The example runs for a single station; loop through all to scale.

üìÅ Make sure your folders (e.g., `2015/`, `2016/`) and shapefiles are in the correct paths as referenced in the notebooks.
